### Python Challenges
1. **Simple Calculator** - Write a Python script that takes two numbers and a basic arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as input and outputs the result.
2. **List Comprehensions** - Use list comprehensions to generate a list of squares of the first 10 positive integers.
3. **File Operations** - Read a text file, count the frequency of each word, and write the results to a new file.
4. **Decorator Function** - Implement a decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
5. **Generators** - Create a generator function that yields an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

### C/C++ Challenges
6. **Memory Management** - Write a C++ program that dynamically allocates an array of integers, modifies it, and then properly deallocates it.
7. **Class Inheritance** - Implement a simple class hierarchy representing geometric shapes with methods to compute area and perimeter.
8. **Template Functions** - Create a template function in C++ that can accept any numerical data type and return its square.
9. **Multithreading** - Write a C++ program that uses multiple threads to parallelize a simple computational task, like calculating factorial of different numbers.
10. **Smart Pointers** - Refactor a legacy C++ code that uses raw pointers to use smart pointers instead.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Challenges
11. **DOM Manipulation** - Create a simple HTML/CSS page and write JavaScript to dynamically change the content when a user clicks a button.
12. **Asynchronous Fetch** - Use `fetch` to retrieve user data from a public API and display it on a webpage.
13. **TypeScript Interfaces** - Define a TypeScript interface for a `User` object and write a function that takes a `User` object and logs a specific greeting.
14. **Promises and Async/Await** - Convert a series of nested callbacks into clean code using Promises and then refactor it to use async/await.
15. **Functional Programming** - Write a TypeScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the numbers that are divisible by a given divisor, using functional programming concepts like `filter`.

### Go Challenges
16. **Hello World API** - Write a simple HTTP server in Go that responds to `/hello` route with a "Hello, World!" message.
17. **Goroutines and Channels** - Implement a Go program that uses goroutines and channels to perform a concurrent calculation, such as summing the elements of an array.
18. **Interface Implementation** - Define an interface for a vehicle, and implement it in different structs representing different types of vehicles.
19. **Error Handling** - Write a Go program that opens a file and reads its contents, properly handling any errors that might occur using idiomatic Go error handling.
20. **Dependency Injection** - Implement a simple dependency injection pattern in Go to manage dependencies in a small application.
